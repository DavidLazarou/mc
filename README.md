# Option Pricing Simulation Project

This project estimates European and binary option prices using the expected value of discounted payoff under the risk-neutral measure. The stock price is simulated using:

- Euler-Maruyama Scheme
- Milstein Scheme
- Closed-form solution (Black-Scholes)

## Sample Parameters

- Initial Stock Price (S₀): 100  
- Strike Price (E): 100  
- Time to Expiry (T): 1 year  
- Volatility (σ): 20%  
- Risk-Free Rate (r): 5%
